If you are experiencing any or all of the following problems when trying
to play Golden Gate, you need the Golden Gate Patch:

The "Jack In The Box" puzzle locks up when I attempt to pull the handle
The "Esperance" puzzle (Angel Flute or Statue) locks up when I try to play a note
The game goes on auto pilot and navigates me through the city without my control
